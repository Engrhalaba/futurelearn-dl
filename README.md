# futurelearn-dl

A script to download materials from the FutureLearn website (for enrolled courses)

## NOTE: This does not work, it's a horrible hack, I'm throwing this out there because people have requested it and because I need it myself (but don't have the time to invest right now).

## NOTE: I did not write the original script, I adapted a script which was posted as a Gist here:
  https://gist.github.com/nonsleepr/11401542

This is currently a bash script and even the initial login is failing - although we seem to obtain a valid token.

## Usage:
'''
    futurelearn-dl.sh  <course-id> <username> <password>

e.g.

    futurelearn-dl.sh  data-to-insight user password
   
'''

## TODO:
- Fix ;-)
- Rewrite in a real language such as Python3
